"""
Creates a stack implementation in Python - under-the-hood list container

Notes for code review:
    - Error handling
    - Add more types
    - fix bugs when you try to add a token that is not the same type as the array
    - include git tagging (semantic versions)
    - abstraction/virtual functions for similiar datastructures
