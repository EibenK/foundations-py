# foundations-py

A personal project aimed at rebuilding and reinforcing core computer science knowledge through hands-on implementation of data structures and algorithms from scratch.

This repository is a ground-up effort to solidify and revisit the fundamentals that power efficient software engineering, with a strong emphasis on clean code,
modular design and real-world applicability. 

# Purpose
- Rebuild foundational knowledge in Python
- Gain a deeper understanding of core data structures and algorithms by implementing them without relying on built-in datastructures 
- Lay a modular groundwork for use in future technical projects and interview preparation

# Weekly Commitment
- Try to implement one new data structure or algorithm
- Weekly Review: Refactor, optimize, and document implementations
